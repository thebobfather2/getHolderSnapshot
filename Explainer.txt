1.  Open getHolderSnapshot folder.
2. Run node getSnapshot.js input.txt output.json (wait for it to finish)
3. Run node filter.js
4. Run solana config set -u mainnet-beta -k BRSCAJg56nkH7rxH5mAPpx3GVLgQ58Bx5kejFkZnacie.json
5. Run python airdrop.py transfer -a wallets.txt --drop 7 --fund-recipient --allow-unfunded-recipient
6. Press 1 for first prompt (selects quicknode rpc)
7. Paste in CARoTGvYPajELZsoLQSovLY8fZmBkrrUoyJVJN3zGwQT for mint
8. Press 0 for decimals
9 Type ALL and hit enter and it will run through all of them.
10.  It will dump all logs into that folder.
11.  Unconfirmed usually have gone through, failed usually not, but can't be certain.  If there are a huge amount, I just ask people to make a ticket, check their wallet against the wallets.txt and how many were sent via solscan and manually send the rest.
